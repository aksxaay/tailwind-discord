## tailwind-discord


Well I will be trying to use a front end framework..
Discord inspired Dash-board...



- sideboard that shows tooltips
- animated icon buttons
- dark mode asw

mostly taken from [Fireship // Tailwind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfaSUYaSgRo&t=56s)


### What is tailwind?
collection of css utility classes
- less code overall compared to plain css


However tailwind does not provide pre-built components like bootstrap
 it takes longer to build an UI compared to bootstrap

 But much better for customization

 really good tooling.

It's like CSS with training-wheels
- Dead Code Elimination


Tailwind also works with pretty much any framework..

-- created blank react template
`npx create-react-app my-project`

to rename project just change **folder name** and edit **name** parameter in `package.json`

## Project Instructions
[create-react-app // tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)

apparently gotta install craco
'ince Create React App doesn’t let you override the PostCSS configuration natively, we also need to install **CRACO** to be able to configure Tailwind:'

- Override native PostCSS configuration


check if all packages present and run 
`npx start`



What if I streamed until I became a millionaire HUH?


I'mma list out all the things I can do, and then work on them every single day.. Let's see how fast I could get to being a millionaire...

Millionaire speed-run perhaps..
I'll try to get my basic expenditure paid for, but other than that..
like food and shit..
